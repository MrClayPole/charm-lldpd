options:
  i40e-lldp-stop:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      This allows control over Intel's i40e NIC driver. By default
      i40e blocks userspace LLDP and does it on its own. Setting this
      option to 'True' means charm will disable this functionality in
      the NIC and do it within userspace.
  interfaces-regex:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      Which interfaces should lldpd announce details. If you want lldpd
      to listen on multiple interfaces, set it here. Examples:

      seth*,meth*

      You can also use exclamation mark to exclude an interface:

      eth*,!eth1

      This way lldpd will listen on all eth* interfaces with an
      exception of eth1.

      By default this is set to None, which puts lldpd in listening
      mode only.
  systemid-from-interface:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      Pull systemID from this interface
  enable-snmp:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Enable the SNMP agent for LLDPD
  short-name:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Set short name in SysName instead of FQDN
  nagios_context:
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      Comma separated list of nagios service groups for the check
